## Solution of the Laplace and Poisson equations

We consider the second-order differential equations

::: {.callout-tip title="Laplace equation"}
$$
\dv[2]{y}{x} = 0
$$
:::

and 

::: {.callout-tip title="Poisson equation"}
$$
\dv[2]{y}{x} = -4\cos(4x) - 8 \sin(8 x)
$$
:::

for $x \in [0, 1]$ subject to the boundary conditions $y(0)=1$ and $y(1)=0$.

To obtain the solution to the above PDEs, we employ the `Python` package `sympy`, which is a powerful library for symbolic mathematics.

Symbolic functions which depend on symbolic variables have to be defined with the function `Function`.

The solution of the differential equations can be obtained by a call to the `dsolve` function.

The signature of the function can be understood as follows:

-   Solve the symbolic equation given by the expressions `eq_poisson` and `eq_laplace`, resp.
-   The desired solution is `y(x)`
-   Boundary conditions can be enforced by the values following the keyword `ics`. In the example, `y(0)=1` and `y(1)=0`.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
from sympy import Function, dsolve, diff, cos, sin
from sympy.abc import x
from sympy.plotting import plot, PlotGrid
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

y = Function('y')
eq_poisson = diff(y(x), x, 2) + 4 * cos(4 * x) + 8 * sin(8 * x)
eq_laplace = diff(y(x), x, 2)
result_poisson = dsolve(eq_poisson, y(x), ics={y(0): 1, y(1): 0})
result_laplace = dsolve(eq_laplace, y(x), ics={y(0): 1, y(1): 0})
p1 = plot(result_poisson.rhs, (x, 0, 1), 
      ylim=(-0.2, 1.2), 
      ylabel='y(x)', 
      axis_center='auto',
      show=False,
      title='Poisson equation');
p2 = plot(result_laplace.rhs, (x, 0, 1), 
      ylim=(-0.2, 1.2), 
      ylabel='y(x)', 
      axis_center='auto',
      show=False,
      title='Laplace equation');
PlotGrid(1, 2, p1, p2, size=(7,3));
```
## What can be observed in the 1-D case?

-   The solution of the *Laplace equation* does not exhibit local extrema
    -   It has no curvature
-   The solution of the *Poisson equation* has local minima and maxima
    -   Its extrema might get larger or smaller than those of the Dirichlet values at the boundary
