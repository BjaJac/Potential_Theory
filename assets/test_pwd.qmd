```{julia}
model = GmshDiscreteModel("circle.msh")
```


```{julia}
pwd()

# opening a file in read_mode
# r is the default mode

f = open("circle.msh", "r")

# to count total lines in the file
line_count = 0			

for lines in readlines(f)

	# increment line_count
	global line_count += 1

	# print the line
	#println(lines)	 

end

# total lines in file
println("line count is $line_count")

close(f)
