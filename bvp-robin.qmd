title: "Robin problems"

The _Robin problem_ is a boundary value problem for partial differential equations, where the boundary condition is a combination of the function value and its normal derivative. It is a generalization of both the Dirichlet and Neumann problems.

The _Robin boundary condition_ combines the function value $u$ and its normal derivative 
$\pdv{u}{n}$ on the boundary:

$$
\alpha u + \beta \pdv{u}{n} = w \text{ on } \partial\Omega,
$$

where

- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are given coefficients, which can be functions defined on $\partial\Omega$,
- $w$ is a given function defined on $\partial\Omega$.

## Objective

The goal is to find a function $u$ such that

1. $u$ satisfies the Poisson equation $\Delta u = f$ in the domain $\Omega$,
2. $u$ satisfies the Robin boundary condition $\alpha u + \beta \pdv{u}{n} = w$ on $\partial\Omega$.

## Formal definition

Find a function $u: \overline{\Omega} \mapsto \mathbb R$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta u & = f \text{ in } \Omega \\
\alpha u + \beta \pdv{u}{n} & = w \text{ on } \partial\Omega
\end{align}
$$

## Special cases

- If $\beta=0$, the Robin condition reduces to the Dirichlet boundary condition $u = w/\alpha$,
- If $\alpha=0$, the Robin condition reduces to the Neumann boundary condition $\pdv{u}{n} = w/\beta$,

## Applications

The Robin problem is used in various physical contexts, such as:

- Heat transfer, where the boundary condition represents a combination of conduction and convection,
- DC resistivity problems, where Robin conditions model the behaviour of the problem at the boundary.

The Robin problem provides a more flexible model that can interpolate between purely Dirichlet or Neumann conditions and model more complex boundary interactions.
