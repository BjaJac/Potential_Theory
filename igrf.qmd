![Earth's total magnetic field intensity at the WGS84 surface for Jan 1st, 2025. Contour lines in nT.](images/totalfield-globe-tilted.gif)

The goal of this section is to describe the main geomagnetic field $\vb B(r, \theta, \varphi, t)$ produced primarily by internal sources inside Earth's core.

The description in terms of a potential is valid on and above Earth's surface, where the main magnetic field can be represented by the gradient of a scalar function, i.e., $\vb B = -\grad V$.

The potential function $V(r, \theta, \varphi, t)$ is represented as a finite series expansion in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients, $g_n^m$ and $h_n^m$, also known as _Gauss coefficients_:

$$
V(r, \theta, \varphi, t) = a \sum\limits_{n=1}^N \sum\limits_{m=0}^n \left( \frac{a}{r} \right)^{n+1}
\left[
g_n^m(t) \cos m \varphi + h_n^m(t) \sin m \varphi
\right]
P_n^m(\cos\theta).
$$ {#eq-igrf-potential}

Here, $r, \theta$ and $\varphi$ refer to coordinates in a geocentric spherical coordinate system with $r$ being the radial distance from the center of the Earth, and $\theta, \varphi$ being geocentric co-latitude and longitude, resp.

As reference radius, the approximate mean radius of the Earth of $a=6371.2$ km is chosen. The factor $a^{n+2}$ is chosen so that the Gauss coefficients will have units of magnetic flux density.

The $P_n^m(\cos\theta)$ are Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre functions of degree $n$ and order $m$.

The parameter $N$ specifies the maximum spherical harmonic degree of expansion.

The Gauss coefficients change in time.


## The geomagnetic components

The magnetic field on or above the Earth is usually described in terms of its Cartesian components $X, Y$ and $Z$.

The coordinate system is oriented such that $X$ is pointing towards true magnetic North, $Y$ is pointing eastwards, $Z$ is pointing downwards.

The projection of the magnetic field line onto the horizontal plane tangential to the Earth's surface is called $H$.
The angle between $H$ and true North is referred to as _magnetic declination_.

The geomagnetic field of internal origin is

$$
\vb B(r, \theta, \varphi) = -\pdv{V}{r}\vb e_r - \frac{1}{r}\pdv{V}{\theta}\vb e_\theta
-\frac{1}{r \sin\theta} \pdv{V}{\varphi}\vb e_\varphi,
$$

in which $\vb e_r$, $\vb e_\theta$, $\vb e_\varphi$ are unit vectors in spherical coordinates.

The following table shows the relation between the field components in Cartesian and spherical coordinates:

| $\mathbf B(x,y,z)=$ | $\mathbf B(r, \varphi, \theta)=$ | $-\nabla V=$                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $X \mathbf e_x$     | $-B_\theta \mathbf e_\theta$  | $+\dfrac{1}{r}\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial \theta}\mathbf e_\theta$         |
| $Y \mathbf e_y$     | $+B_\varphi \mathbf e_\varphi$      | $-\dfrac{1}{r \sin\theta}\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial \varphi}\mathbf e_\varphi$ |
| $Z \mathbf e_z$     | $-B_r \mathbf e_r$            | $+\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial r}\mathbf e_r$                     |

For the components in spherical coordinates we find

$$
B_r = -Z = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} =+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=0}^{n}(n+1)
\left(
\frac{a}{r}\right)^{n+2}
\left[g_{n}^{m} \cos m \varphi+h_{n}^{m} \sin m \varphi\right] P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta)
$$

$$
B_\theta = -X = -\frac{1}{r}\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial \theta} = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=0}^{n}\left( \frac{a}{r} \right)^{n+2} \left[g_{n}^{m} \cos m \varphi+h_{n}^{m} \sin m \varphi\right] \frac{\partial P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta)}{\partial \theta}
$$

$$
B_\varphi = +Y =  -\frac{1}{r \sin\theta}\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial \varphi}
=-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=0}^{n}\left( \frac{a}{r} \right)^{n+2}\left[-g_{n}^{m} \sin m \varphi+h_{n}^{m} \cos m \varphi\right] \frac{1}{\sin \theta} P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta)
$$

## The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF)

Link to the Gauss coefficients and general information about the 14th generation of the IGRF is [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-geomagnetic-reference-field).

The IGRF provides Gauss coefficients $g_n^m, h_n^m$ and their respective time derivatives $\dot{g}_n^m, \dot{h}_n^m$ (in units of nT and nT/year, resp.) for a truncated spherical harmonic expansion up to degree $N=13$.
The IGRF is valid for a 5-year interval referred to as epoch.

The Gauss coefficients have a linear time dependency valid for one epoch. In the case of IGRF-14, the epoch starts with Jan 1st, 2025, and ends Jan 1st, 2030.
Starting from $T_0=2025$, we can extrapolate

$$
g_n^m(t) = g_n^m(T_0) + \dot{g}_n^m(T_0)(t - T_0)
$$
and
$$
h_n^m(t) = h_n^m(T_0) + \dot{h}_n^m(T_0)(t - T_0).
$$

## The dipole field

The first three Gauss coefficients $g_1^0, g_1^1, h_1^1$ can be used to calculate the contribution to the dipole field of the Earth.

From the IGRF-14, we get

| g/h | n | m | coeff. in nT |
|---|---|---|----------------|
| g | 1 | 0 | -29350.0      |
| g | 1 | 1 | -1410.3        |
| h | 1 | 1 | 4545.5         |

We see from @eq-igrf-potential, that for $n=1$ we can write the dipole potential as

$$
V^D(r, \theta, \varphi) = \frac{a^3}{r^2} \left[ 
    g_1^0 P_1^0(\cos\theta) + (g_1^1 \cos\varphi + h_1^1 \sin\varphi)P_1^1(\cos\theta)
\right].
$$

Note that

$$
P_1^0(\cos\theta) = \cos\theta, \quad P_1^1(\cos\theta) = \sin\theta,
$$

which yields

$$
V_D = \frac{a^3}{r^2} \left[ 
    g_1^0 \cos\theta + g_1^1 \cos\varphi \sin\theta + h_1^1 \sin\varphi \sin\theta
    \right].
$$

Change from spherical to Cartesian coordinates gives

$$
V^D = \frac{a^3}{r^2} \left[  g_1^0 \frac{z}{r} + g_1^1 \frac{x}{r} + h_1^1 \frac{y}{r}
\right].
$$

We compare this result with the well-known potential for a magnetic dipole with dipole moment $\vb m = [m_x, m_y, m_z]^\top$:

$$
\begin{align}
V & = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\vb m \cdot \vb e_r}{r^2} \\
& = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left[  m_x \frac{x}{r} + m_y \frac{y}{r} + m_z \frac{z}{r} \right]
\end{align}
$$

We identify, e.g., that

$$
\frac{a^3}{r^2}g_1^0 = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} m_z,
$$

which enables us to calculate the magnetic dipole moment of the Earth in units of A$\cdot$m$^2$ component-wise:

$$
\begin{align}
m_x & = \frac{4 \pi}{\mu_0} a^3 g_1^1 =  -0.37 \times 10^{22} \\
m_x & = \frac{4 \pi}{\mu_0} a^3 g_1^1 = 1.18 \times 10^{22} \\
m_x & = \frac{4 \pi}{\mu_0} a^3 g_1^1 = -7.59 \times 10^{22}
\end{align}
$$

The magnititude of the dipole moment is $m = 7.69 \times 10^{22}$  A$\cdot$m$^2$.

From the components of the dipole moment we can infer the axis of the dipole in terms of the angles of orientation.

We get

$$
\theta_S = \arccos\frac{m_z}{m} = 170.7\textdegree
$$
and
$$
\varphi_S = \arccos\frac{m_x}{\sqrt{m_x^2 + m_y^2}} = 107.4\textdegree.
$$

This refers to the point where the dipole axis intersects the surface of the Earth ain the southern hemisphere.
In the northern hemisphere, we have

$$
\theta_N = 9.3\textdegree \text{ and } \varphi_N = 72.6\textdegree. 
$$

We refer to these points as the _geomagnetic pole_.

The _magnetic poles_ are located at the points where the observed magnetic field is purely vertical with respect to the surface of the Earth, i.e., where we observe $H=0$ and an inclination angle of 90$\textdegree$.

## Estimation of the Gauss coefficients

In the spherical harmonics expansion @eq-igrf-potential, the Gauss coefficients appear as linear coefficients.

Given suffiently many observations of the field components, the coefficients can be estimated using the Method of Least Squares.
