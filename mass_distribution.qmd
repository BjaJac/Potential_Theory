The gravitational potential of a spatial mass distribution follows the principle of linear superposition.

The potential can be composed as the sum of the individual potentials of point masses

$$
V(\vb r) = -f \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{m_i}{|\vb r - \vb r_i}, \qfor |\vb r - \vb r'| \ne 0.
$$

For a continuous mass distribution with density $\rho(\vb r)$, a mass $\dd m(\vb r) = \rho(\vb r)  \dd{^3 {\vb r}}$ must be assigned to each volume element.
The summation gets replaced by an integration

$$
V(\vb r) = -f \int\limits_G \frac{\dd m (\vb r')}{| \vb r - \vb r'|} = -f \int\limits_G \frac{ \rho(\vb r')  \dd{^3 {\vb r'}}}{| \vb r - \vb r'|}
$$

This is Newton's volume potential.

In practical applications the difficulty is to integrate over non-trivial, complicated geometries of the domain $G$. 

In the next section we demonstrate the integration over spherical shells and spheres.
