title: "Domains"
---

The domain $\Omega$ in which we seek the solution to the Poisson equation, consists of $n$ subdomains $\Omega_i$, where the union of the subdomains is

$$
\Omega = \Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2 \cup \dots \cup \Omega_n
$$

and the intersection of two subdomains is always

$$
\Omega_i \cap \Omega_k = \emptyset, \quad i \ne k.
$$

Across the individual $\Omega_i$ the physical parameters, e.g., conductivity, density, are usually constant.
