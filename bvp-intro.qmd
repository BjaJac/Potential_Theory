In the previous chapters we have studied solutions to the Poisson and Laplace equations for simple geometries with homogeneous density distributions.

The following chapters introduce techniques which will enable us to calculate potentials and their gradients in a subdomain $\Omega$ that does not contain the sources.

However, we incorporate the _effect_ of the sources by enforcing boundary conditions along the boundaries $\partial\Omega$ of the subdomain.

The ultimate goal is to find a solution of the Poisson (or similar) PDE.

The Poisson equation

$$
\Delta U(\vb r) = f(\vb r)
$$

with $\vb r \in \Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$ has no unique solution, if no further conditions on $U(\vb r)$ are enforced.

The function
$$
\Phi(x,y,z) = e^{\alpha x + \beta y} \sin(\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}z)
$$

is a solution of the PDE $\Delta \Phi = 0$ for arbitrary choices of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Hence, the solution is _non-unique_.

However, the solution space can be restricted by proper choices of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Check using `SymPy`:

```{python}
import sympy as sp
from IPython.display import display, Math
alpha, beta, x, y, z = sp.symbols('alpha beta x y z') 
Phi = sp.exp(alpha * x + beta * y) * sp.sin(sp.sqrt(alpha**2 + beta**2) * z)
display(Math('\\Phi = ' + sp.latex(Phi)))
Phi
```

```{python}
LPhi = sp.diff(Phi, x, 2) + sp.diff(Phi, y, 2) + sp.diff(Phi, z, 2)
display(Math('\\Delta\\Phi = ' + sp.latex(LPhi.simplify())))
```

## Classification of Boundary Value Problems (BVP)

In potential theory we will study the following _boundary value problems_:

- Dirichlet problem
- Neumann problem
- Robin or Mixed Dirichlet-Neumann problem

::: {.callout-note title="Typical problems"}

- Point source within a conducting half-space
- Point source embedded in one of two adjacent conducting half-spaces
- Point source in the top layer of a 2-layer case
- Potential of a conductive semi-sphere embedded in a homogeneous half-space
- Horizontal cylinder in a homogeneous electrical field
- DC resistivity sounding over a half-space consisting of $N$ horizontal layers

:::

For the solution of these problems, we will use the following tools:

- Green's function
- Method of images
- Finite Element Method

## Notation

Domain: $\Omega$

Boundary: $\partial\Omega$

![](images/sketch-omega-domega.excalidraw.svg)

We distinguish between the _open domain_ $\Omega$ and its _boundary_ $\partial\Omega$.

The _closed domain_ $\overline\Omega$ is the union of the interior and the boundary.
